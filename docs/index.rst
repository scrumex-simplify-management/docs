Owner of a project, restrictions
--------

Everything is Scrumex belongs to a project. The backlog, team members, sprints and stories are items of the project itself. The creator of the project is the only person that can edit, modify and invite members to collaborate. 
The rest of the team has full access to the items of a project but cannot invite other team members to collaborate, can't delete a project and can't edit its name.
